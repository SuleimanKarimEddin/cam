# This script is executed for every repository that look like `data/<org>/<repo>` directories.
# The script should find all `.csv` files available and join them with the
# files in the `data/` directory. For example, the content of the `data/yegor256/jaxec/LCOM5.csv` file
# will be appended to the content of the `data/LCOM5.csv` file.
#
# It is expected that the content of the "data/yegor256/jaxec/LCOM5.csv" looks like this (the first
# line is the CSV header):
#
# ```
# java_file,LCOM5
# /src/main/java/foo/Hello.java,32
# /src/main/java/bar/test/Another.java,14
# ```
#
# The content of the "data/LCOM5.csv" file should look like this (again, the first line
# is the CSV header):
#
# ```
# repo,java_file,LCOM5
# yegor256/jaxec,/src/main/java/foo/Hello.java,32
# yegor256/jaxec,/src/main/java/bar/test/Another.java,14
# ```
